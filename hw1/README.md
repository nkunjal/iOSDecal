### submission 
#### files to submit
- SwiftPlayground.playground (folder)

To submit, add your playground folder to a private repository (if you don't have free private repositories, get them here with the [github student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack)). If you're new to GitHub, you can find detailed instructions on how to add your assignment to a repo [here](http://iosdecal.com/other_files/submission_instructions.pdf).

Using your private repository, submit your assignment to [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com/courses/9817/assignments/35309/).

### to do
For this week's homework, you'll become more comfortable writing code in Swift, and will get some practice with some of the language's nuances. Though most of the topics in the homework were covered in lecture, you may need to (and are encouraged to) take a look at the [Swift Language Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID309).

Begin by downloading the homework starter code, which can be found in this repository. Open **SwiftPlayground.playground** in Xcode, and follow the instructions found inside.

### grading

To receive credit for this assignment, you will need to pass all of the tests found at the bottom of the playground, which you can run by uncommenting the line `// PlaygroundTests.defaultTestSuite.run()`.

Feel free to ask for help on [Piazza](piazza.com/berkeley/fall2017/cs198001/home) if you get stuck on the assignment or have any issues submitting, and good luck!
